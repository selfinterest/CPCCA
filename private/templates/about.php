                <p>The Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism (CPCCA) was an informal body, composed of members of the 40th Parliament of Canada, which, in 2009 and 2010, held hearings and accepted written submissions on antisemitism in Canada. Membership was drawn from all four parties in the House of Commons, although the Bloc Quebecois withdrew its MPs partway through the process.</p>
                <p>The CPCCA was modeled on a similar process, conducted by British parliamentarians earlier in the decade, into domestic antisemitism in the UK. This inquiry model was found to be well-suited to Canada's parliamentary system, which is based on the British model.</p>
                <p>The CPCCA structured its hearings as closely as possible on the model of formal House of Commons hearings. In recognition of the consensual nature of the fight against antisemitism, MPs from all parties made a conscious effort to keep partisanship to a minimum.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the CPCCA was:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to identify and define the nature of antisemitism in Canada today;</li>
                    <li>to analyze, as far as the evidence would allow, the extent of the problem; and</li>
                    <li>to make practical recommendations as to how the problem could be addressed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A consensus report was issued in June 2011.</p>
